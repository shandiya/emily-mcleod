Iâ€™m a conservation social scientist interested in helping individuals, communities, and organisations act for nature. I currently lead the social science research program at Zoos Victoria, where I explore how to connect people with wildlife and encourage them to engage in conservation behaviours. My research focuses on a range of topics including cat containment behaviours, drivers of sustainable coffee consumption, and responsible wildlife tourism behaviours.
